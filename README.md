## What is Codebreaker?

Codebreaker is a game where you try to hack into other computers. You can do this by using a variety of tools, such as a port scanner, a password cracker, and packet sniffers. Use the money you earn to buy better tools and upgrades to your computer.

## Getting Started

Quick guide to getting started with Codebreaker.

### First Steps

A good place to start is by scanning for systems, you can do this by using the `scan` command. This will scan the local network for other computers. This will show you a list of computers that are on the network. You can then use the `connect` command to connect to a computer (if the firewall allows it).

### Hacking

For pretty much everything you do you're gonna need to be root. You can check which users have root access by using the `user` command. If you're not root, then you use the `user [username]` command to sign in as that user.
